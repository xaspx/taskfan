# ðŸ›¹ Setup a Developing Environment

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* Local developing on Solana means  you will set up a local validator so that programs can be tested before being deployed to the blockchain. 

* In each environment, you will be using one of three networks:
  * **Mainnet**: the production network where all the action happens. Transactions cost real money.
  * **Testnet**: used for stress testing recent releases. Focused on network performance, stability, and validator behavior.
  * **Devnet**: the primary network for development (these tokens have no financial value).
 
<br>

### Development Lifecycle

<br>

1. Set up the development environment with a local blockchain cluster.

2. Create a filesystem wallet and airdrop Solana tokens to it.

3. Write programs. 
    - Programs export a known `entrypoint` symbol which the Solana runtime looks up and calls when invoking a program.

4. Compile the program (down to [Berkley Packet Filter](https://solana.com/docs/programs/faq#berkeley-packet-filter-bpf) byte-code that will then be deployed to the blockchain).

5. Generate the program's public address (a new unique keypair, on which the pubkey is the `program_id`).

6. Deploy the program to the selected blockchain cluster by creating transactions containing the program's byte-code. 

7. Once the entire program is in the blockchain, a final transaction is sent to write all of the buffered byte-code to the program's data account. 
    - This either marks the new program as executable or completes upgrading an existing program.

### Install Required Packages

<br>

#### Dependencies

<br>

* Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
* Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).


<br>

#### Install the `solana-cli`

<br>

* Install `solana-cli` using [these instructions](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development). This will provide commands for:
  - creating and managing file-system Solana wallets/keypairs
  - connecting to Solana clusters
  - building Solana programs
  - deploying your programs to the blockchain
 
* Install the Anchor framework using [these instructions](https://github.com/urani-labs/solana-dev-onboarding-rs/blob/main/chapters/03_anchor.md).

<br>

#### Setting up a `localhost` Blockchain Cluster

<br>

* You can run a full blockchain cluster on your machine and configure solana-cli to use it with these commands:


```shell
solana-test-validator
solana config set --url localhost
```


<br>

#### Creating a File System Wallet and Airdrop Solana tokens

<br>

* To deploy a program with Solana CLI, you need a Solana wallet with SOL tokens.

* To create a simple file system wallet (at `~/.config/solana/id.json`) to use during local developments, type:

```shell
solana-keygen new
```

<br>

* You can set your new wallet as the default:

```
solana config get -k ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

* Aidrop testing Solana tokens:

```shell
solana airdrop 10
solana balance
```

<br>

### Cluster and Public RPC Endpoints

<br>

* The Solana blockchain has several different groups of validators, known as Clusters.

* Each serves different purposes within the ecosystem and contains dedicated API nodes to fulfill JSON-RPC requests.

* The individual nodes within a Cluster are owned and operated by third parties, and each has a public endpoint.

* The Solana Labs organization operates a public RPC endpoint for each Cluster. Each of these public endpoints is subject to rate limits.

* You can check your local config with:

```shell
solana config get

Config File: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: http://localhost:8899
WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:8900/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json 
Commitment: confirmed
```

<br>


#### Devnet

<br>

* Devnet serves as a playground for devs.

* Gossip endpoint at `entrypoint.devnet.solana.com:8001`.

* Devnet endpoint: `https://api.devnet.solana.com`.

* From the CLI, one can connect with:

```shell
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

<br>


#### Testnet

<br>

* Testnet serves as Solana's core contributors stress test.

* Gossip endpoint at `entrypoint.testnet.solana.com:8001`.

* Devnet endpoint: `https://api.testnet.solana.com`.

* From the CLI, one can connect with:

```shell
solana config set --url https://api.testnet.solana.com
```

<br>


#### Mainnet

<br>

* Solana's permissionless, persistent cluster.

* Gossip endpoint at `entrypoint.mainnet-beta.solana.com:8001`.

* Devnet endpoint: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`.

* From the CLI, one can connect with:

```shell
solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

### Useful `solana-cli` Commands

<br>

* Showing a program account:

```shell
solana program show <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
```

<br>

* Getting information about any transaction:

```shell
solana confirm -v <TRANSACTION_HASH>
```

<br>

* Getting the public key:

```shell
solana-keygen pubkey
```

<br>

* Redeploy a Solana Program: 
  
```shell
solana program deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

* If a program has been deployed, and redeployment goes beyond the `max_len` of the account, it's possible to extend the program to fit the larger redeployment:

```shell
solana program extend <PROGRAM_ID> <ADDITIONAL_BYTES>
```

### Useful Solana Dev Resources

<br>

* [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/): a library with many basic Solana tools to interact, send transactions, and read from the blockchain.

* [@solana/spl-token](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/spl-token): a library that contains many of the js/ts bindings needed to interact with SPL tokens. You can use this library to mint new tokens, transfer tokens, etc.

* [wallet-adapter](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter): is a collection of libraries that help bootstrap wallet collections within Solana (such as Phantom, Solflare, and more).


* [VSCode's rust analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer): support for the Rust such as code completion, references, workspace symbol search, semantic syntax highlighting, etc.

* [Seahorse's examples](https://github.com/ameliatastic/seahorse-lang/tree/main/examples): Seahorse's compiler generates intermediate Rust artifacts and uses Anchor for the heavy lifting.
