## Common Security Exploits

<br>


#### Missing Address Check

* Make sure that an account has the expected address (pubkey).
* For example, verifying that an `admin` account is associated with the config account using the constraint `has_one = admin`.

<br>

#### Missing Ownership Check

* Verify that an account is owned by the expected program by using Anchor's `Account<`info, T>` type that checks the owner (instead of `AccountInfo<`info>`).

<br>

#### Missing Signer Check

* This vulnerability occurs when an account is not signed so anyone who knows the user pubkey can use it in a transaction.
* A solution is to replace `AccountInfo<'info>` with `Signer<'info>`.

<br>

#### Exploiting Arbitrary CPI

* Verify that the target program to be invoked has the correct address.
* For example, if the main program invokes an external program to transfer funds from a user account to a pool account and the program does not verify the address of the external program, an arbitrary code execution can happen.
* To mitigate, replace the `AccountInfo<'info>` type (which is unverified) with Anchor's `Program<'info, T>` type.
* Note that Anchor supports `System`, `Token`, and `AssociatedToken` programs, but other programs must have the CPI modules generated.

<br>

#### Math & Logic Issues

* Beware of arithmetics and precision issues.
* Validate account data and instruction parameters.
* Make sure instructions are executed in the correct order.
* Make sure to prevent unintended behavior when passing duplicated accounts.
 
<br>

#### Reinitialization and Revival Attacks

* Make sure not to re-initialize an already-initialized account.
* Make sure to refrain from re-using an already closed account.
* To learn more, check out [soldev.app's lesson on Reinitialization Attacks](https://www.soldev.app/course/reinitialization-attacks).


<br>

#### PDAs

* Use canonical bump to avoid multiple valid PDAs (never let the user define an arbitrary bump).
* Do not share global PDA authorities; instead, use account-specific PDAs.
* To learn more, check out [soldev.app's lesson on Bump Seed Canonicalization](https://www.soldev.app/course/bump-seed-canonicalization).
