# ðŸ›¹ Transfer Hooks

<br>

### tl; dr


<br>

* The [Transfer Hook Interface](https://spl.solana.com/transfer-hook-interface), introduced within the [Solana Program Library](https://spl.solana.com/) allows token creators to "hook" additional custom logic into token transfers to shape the dynamics of users' and tokens' interactions.

* Possibilities are unlimited, but here are some examples of logic code that could be implemented with Transfer Hooks:
    - NFT Royalties
    - Black or white list wallets that can receive tokens
    - Implementing custom fees on token transfers
    - Track statistics over your token transfers
    - Custom token transfer events

### How Token Hooks Work

<br>

* Whenever the token is transferred, an `Execute` instruction is triggered together with a Transfer Instruction (the custom logic).

* For every token transfer involving tokens from the Mint Account, the Token Extensions program invokes a Cross-Program Instruction (CPI) to execute an instruction on the Transfer Hook program.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mint Accounts**: Mint Accounts: To create a new token, the `create-token()` function is used to initialize a new Mint Account, which contains basic information about the token. This account stores general information about the token and who has permissions over it. Data about particular individuals' token holdings are stored in Token Accounts.



<br>

* All accounts from the initial transfer are converted to read-only accounts (i.e., the sender's signer privileges do not extend to the Transfer Hook program).


* Extra accounts required by `Execute` are stored in a predefined PDA that must be derived using the following seeds: `extra-account-metas` string, the mint account address, and the transfer hook `_id`:

<br>

```javascript
const [pda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [Buffer.from("extra-account-metas"), 
    mint.publicKey.toBuffer()],
    program.program_id, 
);
```

### Specifications

<br>

* [The Transfer Hook interface specification](https://spl.solana.com/transfer-hook-interface/specification) includes two optional instructions and one required one; each uses a specific 8-byte discriminator at the start of its data.

* The `Execute` instruction is required, and this is the instruction in which custom transfer functionality lives. It contains the following parts:
    - `Discriminator`, the first 8 bytes of the hash of "spl-transfer-hook-interface:execute"
    - `Data`:
        - `amount`: `u64`, the transfer amount
        - `accounts`:
            - 1 `[]`: Source token account
            - 2 `[]`: Mint
            - 3 `[]`: Destination token account
            - 4 `[]`: Source token account authority
            - 5 `[]`: Validation account

* `InitializeExtraAccountMetaList` is optional and initializes the validation account to store a list of extra required `AccountMeta` configurations for the `Execute` instruction.
    - The validation account is a PDA off of the transfer hook program, derived with the following seeds: `"extra-account-metas" + <mint-address>`.

* `UpdateExtraAccountMetaList` is optional and allows an on-chain program to update its list of required accounts for `Execute`.
