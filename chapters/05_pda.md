# ðŸ›¹ Program Derived Addresses


<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* PDAs can be thought of as a way of mimicking Web2's databases by writing schemas. For instance, a dApp that needs to update its own data without having a 'client' authorizing those changes.

* PDAs are addresses with special properties. They are not public keys (so they don't have an associated public key).

* PDAs provide a mechanism to build hashmap-like structures on-chain, allowing programs to sign instructions.
    * `findProgramAddress()` will deterministically derive a PDA from a `program_id` and seeds (collection of bytes).
    * A bump (one byte) is used to push a potential PDA off the ed25519 elliptic curve.
    * Programs can sign for their PDAs by providing the seeds and bump to `invoke_signed`.

* PDAs simplify the programming model and make programs more secure.

### Generating PDA

<br>

#### *When you use seeds to derive a public key, there is a chance that the seed you use and the public derived from them have an associated private key (depicted by the ed2559 elliptic curve).*
#### *So if the seeds derive a private key that exists in the curve, Solana will add an additional integer (a bump) to the seed list to make sure it bumps off the curve and cannot have a private key.*

<br>

* PDAs are created by hashing a number of seeds the user can choose with the `program_id`.

* Seeds can be anything: pubkey, strings, an array of numbers, etc.

* There is a 50% chance that this hash can result in a public key. This is how a bump can be searched:

<br>


```rust
fn find_pda(seeds, program_id) {
  for bump in 0..256 {
    let potential_pda = hash(seeds, bump, program_id);
    if is_pubkey(potential_pda) {
      continue;
    }
    return (potential_pda, bump);
  }
  panic!("Could not find pda after 256 tries.");
}
```

<br>

* The first bump that results in a PDA is called a "canonical bump," and they are the recommended one for usage.

<br>

### Interacting with PDAS

<br>

* When a PDA is generated, `findProgramAddress()` returns both the address and the bump used to kick the address off the elliptic curve.

* With a bump, a program can sign any instruction that requires its PDA, by passing the instruction, the list of accounts, and the seeds and bumps used to derive the PDA to `invoke_signed`.

### Hashmap-like Structures with PDAs

<br>

* PDAs are hashed from a bump, a `program_id`, and several seeds. These seeds can be used to build hashmap-like structures on-chain.

* With PDAs, you can create structs that encode the information about a relationship between the user and some data account, so that PDAs serve as the address:

<br>

```rust
pub struct UserStats {
  level: u16,
  name: String,
  bump: u8
}
```

<br>

### CPI Signing with PDAs

<br>


* In some cases, it's possible to reduce the number of accounts needed by making a PDA storing state also sign a CPI instead of defining a separate PDA for that.

* This means that programs can be given control over assets, which they then manage according to the rules defined in the code.

<br>

### Examples of PDAs

<br>

* A program with a global state:

```javascript
const [pda, bump] = await findProgramAddress(Buffer.from("GLOBAL_STATE"), program_id)
```

<br>

* A program with user-specific data:

```javascript
const [pda, bump] = await web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
  [
    publicKey.toBuffer()
  ],
  program_id
)
```

<br>

* A program with multiple data items per user:

```javascript
const [pda, bump] = await web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
  [
    publicKey.toBuffer(), 
    Buffer.from("Shopping list")
  ],
  program_id,
);
```

<br>

> :bulb: **Tip:**  If `find_program_address` has to take a long time to find a valid address (i.e., it as a high bump) the compute unit usage might be high. Finding the PDAs after initialization can be optimized by saving the bump into an account.
